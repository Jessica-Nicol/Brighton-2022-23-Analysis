# Brighton 2022/23 Player Analysis
### This project analyses player data from Brighton & Hove Albion's 2022/23 Premier League season
## The Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the [standard_stats.csv](data/standard_stats.csv) file, each row represents a player and their corresponding statistics across the season.

The data used has been taken from [https://fbref.com](https://fbref.com).
## Potential Uses of this Analysis
### xG vs Actual Goals Scatter Graph
This graph is used to show each player's expected goals against their actual goals during the season. This data could be used to highlight players that are underachieving and overachieving in terms of successfully scoring by looking at their position against the line of equality (dotted line in the graph).
### Yellow Card Bar Chart
This graph is used to show the top 5 most carded players in the team across the season. This could be useful when assessing playing style (which players are often more aggressive) and therefore could aid in tactical planning.
### Goals and Assists Stacked Bar Chart
This graph shows the top 5 attacking players, where goals and assists are separated. It can be used to compare overall attacking output and see which players are more well-rounded in terms of scoring and creating goals.
